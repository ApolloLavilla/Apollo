Trivias:

- Did you know that Julius is the 28th person to hold the title of Wizard King, and while he almost died during the Reincarnation arc, he survives and hold onto the title moving into the following arcs.
- There are 4 great spirits in black clover but only 3 are known for now.
- Yuno is more popular than the main character which is asta. Crazy right?

Well that's the overview of black clover. Thank you for reading!
